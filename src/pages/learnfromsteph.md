> A series of 4-14 minute videos with enhanced transcripts that covers the essentials of web development.

Participants who complete the "Learn From Steph" series will be able to build frontend experiences using modern techniques, and have a solid foundation for continuing to learn intermediate and advanced topics.

The series emphasizes semantic HTML, cascade-abiding CSS, and accessibility throughout.

While the series is created with the intention that it is followed linearly, topics can also be absorbed ad-hoc. This is largely thanks to the enhanced transcript format which includes code snippets, progress images, and gifs to help explain lesson topics.

In particular, the following lessons have been well received outside the linear context:

- [Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://dev.to/5t3ph/introduction-to-web-accessibility-5cmp)
- [Intro to Responsive Design](https://dev.to/5t3ph/intro-to-responsive-design-40n3)
- [Intro to Browser Compatibility](https://dev.to/5t3ph/intro-to-browser-compatibility-49bm)
- [Learn How to Make a Website: Set up Your Coding Environment](https://dev.to/5t3ph/learn-how-to-make-a-website-set-up-your-coding-environment-2oeo)
- [Style a Blog Layout with CSS](https://dev.to/5t3ph/style-a-blog-layout-with-css-3elh)
- [CSS Layout and the Box Model](https://dev.to/5t3ph/css-layout-and-the-css-box-model-5h9i)

> These techniques and solutions are aimed at true beginners, whereas my [Modern CSS](https://moderncss.dev) series includes upgrades for those who already have foundational CSS knowledge.
